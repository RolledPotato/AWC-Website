                        <br>1. Avoid foods that are toxic to dogs such as chocolate, onions, and grapes.

                        <br>3. Do not feed them moldy or spoiled food, as it can cause food poisoning.
                        <br>4. Do not feed them raw eggs, as they can contain bacteria such as salmonella. </p>
